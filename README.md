Fedex Delivery Status Prediction

This project involved analyzing a dataset that includes features like shipment times, carrier details, source and destination locations, distance, and delivery status. 

The primary goal was to identify the key factors contributing to shipment delays and to accurately predict the delivery status.

Data columns (total 15 columns):
